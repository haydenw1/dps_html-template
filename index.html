      <p class="text-title">WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE MEDIA ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY MAJOR?</p>

      <p>Back in highschool I experimented with an independent study in printmaking. The entire process was very interesting and I was beginning to understand ink layering. This was my first exposure to the world of print. When I toured RIT I was initially interested in the co-op program. I was also interested in other majors such as Graphic Design and Industrial Design.</p>
      <p> This major is unique because it allows the students to branch off into different paths whether it be website coding, design, or print production while still handling different types of media.</p>

      <p class="text-title">HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE "MEDIA ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY"?</p>

      <p>I would describe Media Arts and Technology as the transformation of content between web and print across multiple media. It’s important to understand the printing process when you’re designing for print. Certain constraints restrict how the designs are created and viewed, especially in print publications such as magazines and books. We receive the toolset and training to help businesses publish their content to different formats including the web.</p>

      <p>Advertising and Public Relations has a strong connection with our major. Most students are taking Advertising and Public Relations as either a minor or immersion. It helps build our communication skills and connects with the idea of publishing to different platforms so that we can reach viewers.</p>

      <p class="text-title">HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR EXPERIENCE AT RIT?</p>

      <p>Throughout the past four years that I’ve been at RIT, I’ve received plenty of support from the faculty and other students. The classes have been informative and relevant and I’ve been building up work experience at the SMS Labs and at Reporter Magazine as the Production Manager. Classes and work keep me occupied throughout the week, however I also enjoy extracurricular activities such as Concert Band, racquetball, and ultimate frisbee.</p>
